\par }{\f1\fs20 \tab 
\par Plan B Security
\par Tod Beardsley, Feb 16, 2002
\par Austin, Texas
\par info@planb-security.net
\par Why Do This?
\par 
\par I often find myself in front of Windows 2000 machines and needing to talk to Linux machines running SSH. I happen to know Cygwin's SSH implementation pretty well, and prefer the command line interface over puTTY's GUI. I wrote this doco for my reference, 
and I figure others might find themselves in a similar predicament.
\par 
\par When I get a minute, I'd like to document exactly how to run a minimal SSH server. So far, all the HOWTOs and documentation I can find is either for pay-fer SSH implementations, or include
 all the extra Cygwin cruft. Ickiness -- but so far, I haven't looked to see exactly what's needed. If you know about a stripped down Cygwin install for sshd, drop me a line, por favor.
\par Pre-Staging
\par 
\par First off, you'll need a mess of directories created:
\par 
\par C:\\temp\tab for some temporary storage
\par C:\\etc\tab for your passwd file
\par C:\\ssh\tab for your ssh binaries
\par C:\\ssh\\.ssh\tab for your known_host file
\par 
\par Note that you can't create a directory with a period as the first character using Explorer. This is, of course, dumb, but hey, you're looking to use a command shell anyway, right? So, use mkdir to create the \\ssh\\.ssh dir, and move on.
\par Getting the Binaries
\par 
\par In the end, all you'll want is cygwin1.dll, cygz.dll, cygcrypt.dll, cygregex.dll and ssh.exe. Bless the RedHat Corporation for making these binaries available for free under the GPL; curse them for making them so hard to get at. }{
\f1\fs20\lang11274\langfe1033\langnp11274 C'est la vie. }{\f1\fs20 Security is hard.
\par 
\par If you don't particularly care about getting the latest versions, you can download all the stuff you need in evil propri
etary Zip format here. These were fetched from the Cygwin project on Feb 16, 2002. Of course, use at your own risk, GPL, blah blah blah.
\par 
\par Otherwise, go to RedHat's Cygwin website is http://sources.redhat.com/cygwin/. Go there, and hit the Install Now! button to run setup.exe.
\par 
\par Then, select the following:
\par 
\par     Download from Internet
\par     C:\\temp as a download directory
\par     Direct Connection (or Proxy or whatever's appropriate for you)
\par     Select a mirror (the first one's usually fine)
\par     Skip everything except
\par 
\par         Base: cygwin
\par         Base: zlib
\par         Libs: openssl
\par         Libs: regex
\par         Net: openssh
\par 
\par You'll need some software that can handle the GNU compression formats. UnxUtils from http://unxutils.sourceforge.net does the trick.
\par 
\par Once they're all extracted, hunt around for cygwin1.dll, cygz.dll, cygregex.dll, cygcrypto.dll, and ssh.exe. Copy these over to C:\\ssh. You're welcome to delete everything else in C:\\temp, now.
\par After that Ordeal
\par 
\par Believe it or not, making it all work is the simple part, compared to the above. There's no registration of DLL's, no install hoops to jumpthrough -- just some trivial copying and text file creation.
\par 
\par First, go to C:\\etc, and make your passwd file, like so:
\par 
\par     echo Username:x:1:10:Username:/ssh/:/winnt/system32/cmd.exe >> passwd 
\par 
\par Username should be your actual NT logon name. This tells ssh where you created your .ssh directory (that's important, later).
\par 
\par Now, flip over to C:\\ssh, and type "ssh." If you have everything, it should spit out the minimal help.
\par 
\par At this point you'll probably want to drop C:\\ssh in your %PATH% by editing My Computer | Properties | Advanced | Environment Variables, shown here:
\par 
\par Screenshot
\par All Set Up
\par 
\par To open an ssh session run:
\par 
\par     ssh -l username ssh.example.com 
\par 
\par The first time you connect anywhere, you'll get hit with the warning that the host isn't known. If you're reasonably certain you're connecting to the right machine, just answer the warnings affirmatively, and the host'
s key will be added to your .ssh/known_hosts file.
\par 
\par Once you have this going, there's not much reason to use your most common insecure, plaintext protocols ever again. For example, to encrypt your POP3 traffic, just use ssh port tunnelling, like so:
\par 
\par     ssh -l username -L 110:ssh.example.com:110 ssh.example.com 
\par 
\par Fetch your mail from localhost, and you'll be forwarding all your traffic along to your real ssh host, all safe and snug in swaddling of strong cryptography.
\par Final Notes
\par 
\par I presume this all works on NT 4.0, and should work with only slight modification under Windows 9x. If you can confirm this, let me know.
\par 
\par These simplified instructions assume you're the only user on your workstation. If that's not the case, you'll want to edit the passwd file to reflect the reality of multiple home directories, NTFS permissions, etc.
\par 
\par I also assume that you don't want the full-blown Cygwin environment from RedHat. Installing the full package set is certainly easier, but if all you want is ssh capabilities, this wi
ll do a body good. Of course, if you ever want to upgrade these binaries, you'll have to do all this hunting around all over again, but hey. You're worth it.
\par 
\par Finally, if you want a GUI interface for some reason, don't bother with any of this. Download PuTTY instead . It's swell if you're into buttons and popup windows and stuff.
